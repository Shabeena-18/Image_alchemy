# Image_alchemy

Image Alchemy is an advanced image editing tool developed to perform a wide range of image processing tasks using Python and OpenCV. The project integrates multiple techniques to enhance and manipulate images for various applications. 
The key features include:

Canny Edge Detection: Identify the edges in images.
Image Resizing: Adjust the dimensions of images while maintaining quality.
Image Cropping: Extract specific regions of interest from images.
Image Thresholding: Apply thresholding techniques for image segmentation.
Gaussian Blur: Smoothen images by reducing noise.
Morphological Operations: Perform operations like erosion, dilation, and more for advanced processing.
Image Rotation: Rotate images by specified degrees.
Contour Detection: Detect and draw contours around shapes in images.
Feature Detection: Identify unique features for object recognition.
Face Detection: Detect faces in images using Haar Cascades.
